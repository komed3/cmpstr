# Workflow: npm Publish on Release
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow builds and publishes the CmpStr package to the
# npm registry when a new GitHub release is created. Only the contents of the
# `dist` directory, along with the README and LICENSE, are published, as defined
# in the package.json `files` array.
