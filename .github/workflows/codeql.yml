# 
# Workflow: CodeQL Analysis
# 
# This GitHub Actions workflow performs static code analysis using GitHub CodeQL
# to detect potential security vulnerabilities and quality issues in the CmpStr
# project.
# 
# CodeQL is a security analysis engine that examines your codebase for known
# patterns of vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, logic errors, or unsafe
# dependencies.
# 
# This will run on every push to the `master` branch, analyzing the codebase
# for JavaScript and TypeScript files. The workflow includes steps to:
# 
#    - Checkout the repository
#    - Set up Node.js environment
#    - Initialize CodeQL with the specified languages
#    - Install project dependencies
#    - Build the project
#    - Perform the CodeQL analysis
#
