# 
# Workflow: CodeQL Analysis
# 
# This GitHub Actions workflow performs static code analysis using GitHub CodeQL
# to detect potential security vulnerabilities and quality issues in the CmpStr
# project.
# 
# CodeQL is a security analysis engine that examines your codebase for known
# patterns of vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, logic errors, or unsafe
# dependencies.
# 
# This will automatically run after a successful merge.
