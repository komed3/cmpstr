# 
# Workflow: Lint, Build & Pack
# 
# This GitHub Actions workflow performs automated type-checking, linting, and
# building for the CmpStr project. It is triggered on every push and pull request
# targeting the master branch.
# 
# The workflow consists of two jobs:
# 
# 1. Lint (TypeScript Linting):
#    - Installs dependencies
#    - Runs TypeScript-based linting and type-checking via `npm run lint`
# 
# 2. Test (Run Tests):
#    - Runs after the Lint job completes successfully
#    - Installs dependencies
#    - Executes tests using `npm test`
# 
# 3. Build (Build & Package):
#    - Runs after the Lint job completes successfully
#    - Installs dependencies
#    - Builds the project using `npm run build`
#    - Uploads the resulting `dist/` directory as an artifact
# 
# 4. Check (Ready for Release):
#    - Runs after the Build job completes successfully
#    - Downloads the `dist/` artifact
#    - Packs the project into an npm tarball using `npm pack`
#    - Unpacks the tarball to validate the presence of expected files
#    - Using `package-verify` with `verify.manifest.json` for validating files
#    - Uploads the tarball as an artifact for further use
