 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone
 * 
 * Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm for indexing words by their (English) pronunciation. It
 * improves upon Soundex by using more sophisticated rules for English spelling and pronunciation.
 * As with Soudex, similar-sounding words are encoded to the same representation, allowing for
 * the comparison of words based on their phonetic representation rather than their spelling.
 * 
 * Later, Metaphone was superseded by Double Metaphone, which supports multiple pronunciations
 * of the same word, but this implementation focuses on the original Metaphone algorithm.
 * 
 * This implementation is designed for maximal performance and memory efficiency, using a
 * simple mapping and a compact rule engine.
